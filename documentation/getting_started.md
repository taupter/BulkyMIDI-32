# 1> Getting started
The [documentation](https://github.com/tebl/BulkyMIDI-32/tree/main/BulkyMIDI-32%20Module#bulkymidi-32-module) that comes with the main module mostly only deals with soldering the device together, additionally there's a separate document on [setting it up](https://github.com/tebl/BulkyMIDI-32/blob/main/documentation/setting_up.md) and ensuring that the device functions as expected. This document therefore assumes that you already have a working device, either because you took great care in constructing it yourself or you simply bought it from a builder that you decided to trust with a meager portion of your disposable income.

Before starting on this adventure, even with a ready-built unit I suggest at least reading through the [basic information](https://github.com/tebl/BulkyMIDI-32/blob/main/documentation/setting_it_up.md#11-basic-information) section of previously mentioned document - if only so that any weird nomenclature found later on it the document becomes a bit less fuzzy. This is by no meant to be an exhaustive source of information for all things MT-32 or MT32-PI, the purpose is simply to provide some form of a starting point for those of us who've always wanted a Roland MT-32 without really knowing how it is supposed to be used.
