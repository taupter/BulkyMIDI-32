# 1> Getting started
The [documentation](https://github.com/tebl/BulkyMIDI-32/tree/main/BulkyMIDI-32%20Module#bulkymidi-32-module) that comes with the main module mostly only deals with soldering the device together, additionally there's a separate document on [setting it up](https://github.com/tebl/BulkyMIDI-32/blob/main/documentation/setting_up.md) and ensuring that the device functions as expected. This document therefore assumes that you already have a working device, either because you took great care in constructing it yourself or you simply bought it from a builder that you decided to trust with a meager portion of your disposable income.

Before starting on this adventure, even with a ready-built unit I suggest at least reading through the [basic information](https://github.com/tebl/BulkyMIDI-32/blob/main/documentation/setting_it_up.md#11-basic-information) section of previously mentioned document - if only so that any weird nomenclature found later on it the document becomes a bit less fuzzy. The video linked above goes into a lot of these things, and even goes into some of the details for using it on specific systems.

This is by no means meant to be an exhaustive source of information for all things *Roland MT-32* or even *MT32-PI*, the purpose is simply to provide some form of a starting point for those of us who've always wanted a *Roland MT-32* without really knowing how they were supposed to be used. As things quickly got out of hand trying to cover everything everywhere, I instead separated out those parts to separate documents for each system - you can find links to those below.
