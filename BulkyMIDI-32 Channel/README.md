# BulkyMIDI-32 Channel
**UNTESTED**
I know that the main *BulkyMIDI-32* has a fancy display that shows instruments and so on, the original *Roland MT-32* also did something similar back when they were still sold in music shops. However, I wanted an excuse to add a ton of LEDs to the project while having a bit of fun with older logic chips. Because, who doesn't want more blinking lights? Noone, that's who. My starting point was an article by W. Dunczewski, titled *MIDI Channel Monitor* that was printed in the [ october 1993](https://worldradiohistory.com/Elektor.htm) issue of *Elektor Electronics*.

While the low-level description of the circuit details is better left to the article itself, I'll only make a brave attempt at describing what it actually aims to accomplish; The purpose of the board is to light up an LED corresponding to each MIDI-channel, but instead of doing it as yet another Arduino-based design - it implements this using using basic logic chips and counters. It does this by waiting for a digital MIDI-message, then picks out the bits that specifies the channel.
