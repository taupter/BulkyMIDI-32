# BulkyMIDI-32
When I was young I'd heard rumours about a fantastical sound card for the computer known as the Roland MT-32, imagining that if it was the default sound device for games such as Monkey Island, then it had to be good. Ofcourse I was a kid without enough money to even be allowed inside the kind of stores that would sell this stuff, so it wouldn't be until I reached adulthood that I learned that it wasn't a sound card at all - it was a standalone MIDI module! The second thing I learned was that they were and still are incredibly expensive items for people who have no business dealing with musical things, especially for those of us that were born without a rhythm (not being able to believably sell the idea of putting it down as a business expense).

Cue the other incredibly talented people on the Internet, in particular for creating the [mt32-pi](https://github.com/dwhinham/mt32-pi) project - allowing you to build a device capable of emulating one of these fantastical devices on a somewhat cheap and somewhat available Raspberry Pi. The next step that happened is that I used their documentation to build a version of the device for myself, but better people have already done that - I based my project files directly on [clymsyMIDI](https://github.com/gmcn42/clumsyMIDI). I can't say I added much to the basic design, I just made it into something that matches my own particular style.

## 1.1> Modules
For the technical details as well as information regarding the modules included by this specific github project, consult the table below - follow the documentation links for build instructions, BOM and anything else of that sort.  Faceplates and any backplates listed are mainly decorative, allowing you to put together something similar to a case without actually requiring a 3d-printer.
