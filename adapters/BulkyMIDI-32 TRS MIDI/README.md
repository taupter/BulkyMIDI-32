# BulkyMIDI-32 TRS MIDI
Working on the [BulkyMIDI-32 Internal](https://github.com/tebl/BulkyMIDI-32/tree/main/BulkyMIDI-32%20Internal) I made the choice of using TRS sockets for the MIDI-signals, thinking that was an easy way to get it connected up to my other equipment - as that would just require buying such a ready-made cable. Unfortunately though, the ones I had ordered up from China were simply wired up wrong - they were intended for audio and did not match any of the known pinouts for MIDI. I did order them up from a music store, but they've been repeatedly delayed so I wanted something I could rely on.

Myself. Meaning that I created this adapter, mainly so that I could simply plug a standard male 3.5mm to male 3.5mm audio cable into it and keep enjoying my MIDI content without waiting for a cable that may or may not arrive sometime soon. Yes I could probably have just ordered one from a really expensive store and have it delivered within a week from some other international site, but I really don't like the fact that the cable would be the most expensive component when building an MT32-PI.

Note that there are several variants of how MIDI over TRS is wired, thankfully the [A simplified guide to MIDI over TRS minijacks](https://minimidi.world/) goes into all of the detail needed to understand both type A and type B. In practice when it comes to the adapater itself, there's a set of jumpers that need to be set according to the equipment you're using.
