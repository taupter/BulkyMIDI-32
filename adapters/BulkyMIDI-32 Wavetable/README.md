# BulkyMIDI-32 Wavetable
*UNTESTED*
While the MT32-PI already have quite a lot of options for connecting the device up to everyones favourite IBM PC/AT compatible computers, but I thought I'd put some efforts into making yet another one - this time attempting to fill the void on my **Sound Blaster 16** by having something to attach to the wavetable header.
