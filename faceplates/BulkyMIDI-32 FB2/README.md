# BulkyMIDI-32 Faceplate (FB2)
A faceplate designed to be installed on the top of my secondary modules as well as the later revisions of the BulkyMIDI-32 itself - it has a cutout for the panel that slot into them (not to be with front plates/FP faceplates as these are just cosmetics to mount on the front). It does not have any electrical components, and should for the most part be considered a cosmetic option though there is probably an argument for the mechanical viability of the panels.

FB2 features the later 8bit version of the logo.

# 1> Schematic
The supplied KiCad files should be sufficient as both a schematic and as a  starting point for ordering PCBs (basically you could just zip the contents of the export folder and upload that on a fabrication site), the schematic is also available in [PDF-format](https://github.com/tebl/BulkyMIDI-32/tree/main/documentation/schematic/faceplates) and this is what you'll need to print and work your way through when things fail to work as expected.

# 2> BOM
Most parts should be easy to get a hold of from your favourite local electronic component shop, but given that I don't have access to such shops where I live so everything was based on whatever I could get cheapest from eBay/AliExpress (free shipping, but plan on waiting 3-4 weeks for delivery).
