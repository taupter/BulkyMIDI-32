# BulkyMIDI-32 Faceplate (FA2)
A faceplate designed to be installed onto the main [BulkyMIDI-32](https://github.com/tebl/BulkyMIDI-32/tree/main/BulkyMIDI-32%20Module)-module, it does not have any electrical components and is purely here as a cosmetic option. There is also a version that includes two of the switches, allowing for a vertical stacking of the user interface -  if that is what you were looking for, check check out [Faceplate FA1](https://github.com/tebl/BulkyMIDI-32/tree/main/faceplates/BulkyMIDI-32%20FA1) instead.

# 1> Schematic
The supplied KiCad files should be sufficient as both a schematic and as a  starting point for ordering PCBs (basically you could just zip the contents of the export folder and upload that on a fabrication site), the schematic is also available in [PDF-format](https://github.com/tebl/BulkyMIDI-32/tree/main/documentation/schematic/faceplates) and this is what you'll need to print and work your way through when things fail to work as expected.

# 2> BOM
Most parts should be easy to get a hold of from your favourite local electronic component shop, but given that I don't have access to such shops where I live so everything was based on whatever I could get cheapest from eBay/AliExpress (free shipping, but plan on waiting 3-4 weeks for delivery).
