# BulkyMIDI-32 Faceplate (FP1)
A faceplate designed to be installed onto [BulkyMIDI-32 Module Panel](https://github.com/tebl/BulkyMIDI-32/tree/main/BulkyMIDI-32%20Module%20Panel), itself then mounted onto the main [BulkyMIDI-32](https://github.com/tebl/BulkyMIDI-32/tree/main/BulkyMIDI-32%20Module)-module. This faceplate does not have any electrical components and exists purely as a cosmetic option.

Faceplate (FP1) in particular was designed for use with a 1.3" oled display, it is intended for use along with the [extras](https://github.com/tebl/BulkyMIDI-32/tree/main/BulkyMIDI-32%20Extras)-board - if you do not intend to build or require the functionality of this board, consider [Faceplate (FP2)](https://github.com/tebl/BulkyMIDI-32/tree/main/faceplates/BulkyMIDI-32%20Module%20FP2) as slightly smaller alternative.

# 1> Schematic
The supplied KiCad files should be sufficient as both a schematic and as a  starting point for ordering PCBs (basically you could just zip the contents of the export folder and upload that on a fabrication site), the schematic is also available in [PDF-format](https://github.com/tebl/BulkyMIDI-32/tree/main/documentation/schematic/faceplates) and this is what you'll need to print and work your way through when things fail to work as expected.

# 2> BOM
Most parts should be easy to get a hold of from your favourite local electronic component shop, but given that I don't have access to such shops where I live so everything was based on whatever I could get cheapest from eBay/AliExpress (free shipping, but plan on waiting 3-4 weeks for delivery).
