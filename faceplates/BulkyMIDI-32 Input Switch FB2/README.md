# BulkyMIDI-32 Input Switch Faceplate (FB2)
A faceplate designed to be installed on the top of my secondary modules as well as the later revisions of the BulkyMIDI-32 itself - it has a cutout for the panel that slot into them (not to be with front plates/FP faceplates as these are just cosmetics to mount on the front). It does not have any electrical components, and should for the most part be considered a cosmetic option though there is probably an argument for the mechanical viability of the panels.

FB2 features the later 8bit version of the logo. As you can probably tell from the name, this vertsion of it was slightly modified for use with the input switch by removing one of the cutouts for the panel. The reason for this is simply that there wasn't any room for one due to the large DIN-connector in its place.

# 1> Schematic
The supplied KiCad files should be sufficient as both a schematic and as a  starting point for ordering PCBs (basically you could just zip the contents of the export folder and upload that on a fabrication site), the schematic is also available in [PDF-format](https://github.com/tebl/BulkyMIDI-32/tree/main/documentation/schematic/faceplates) and this is what you'll need to print and work your way through when things fail to work as expected.

# 2> BOM
Most parts should be easy to get a hold of from your favourite local electronic component shop, but given that I don't have access to such shops where I live so everything was based on whatever I could get cheapest from eBay/AliExpress (free shipping, but plan on waiting 3-4 weeks for delivery).
