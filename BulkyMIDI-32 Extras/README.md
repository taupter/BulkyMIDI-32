# BulkyMIDI-32 Extras
**UNTESTED WORK IN PROGRESS**
Building the BulkyMIDI-32, there were quite a few features that I didn't have enough physical space to implement in any way. There were probably ways around that, but I didn't want the device to look like an electronic hedgehog and few would probably want it anyway - so I moved them onto a separate board instead. This is that board.
